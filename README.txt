# To run this code you need Python.
# Navigate with the terminal, find SortPrograms/SortMe.py
# Run the program by typing "python SortMe.py" and see the results. 
# ^ This will sort the contents of the txt file by letter and then length.

# You can also sort the contents by letter, length and then reverse it by typing:
# " python SortMeReverse.py "


Testing:

Navigate to the same directory as above.
Type the following to test both the regular sort and the sort with the reverse included:
xxxx$ cat SortMe.txt | python SortMe.py > output.txt
xxxx$ cat SortMe.txt | python SortMeReverse.py > output2.txt
xxxx$ ./test.sh

The test will show if either sort passes or fails.
